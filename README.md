# Conditional Generation of Insights using LLMs

> These resources complement the final paper assignment during the XCS224U Natural Language Understanding course

In this assignment, we explore the competency of LLMs in producing automatically generating insights by measuring the hit rate of the system against collected insights generated by Exploratory Data Analysis practitioners.

The repository is organized as follows:

- notebook.ipynb: Contains the experiments done.
- data: Contains each dataset that was tested in the notebook (*.csv) along with the insights of reference (reference.txt)
